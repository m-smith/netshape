Netshape
=========

`netshape` is a versatile tool designed to build interactive, browser-based,
and deployable visualizations of networks. This enables a more collaborative and more informative visualization process.

With `netshape`, a network edgelist is turned into a web-ready interactive visualization with just one command:

```
> netshape build AwesomeNetwork.csv
> netshape server
> echo "let the visualization begin"
```

Netshape is also highly configurable and hackable; it supports custom commands,
which enables the development of complex visualization pipelines.
