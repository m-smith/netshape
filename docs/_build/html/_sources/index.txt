Netshape
====================================

Quickstart
------------------------------------

:code:`netshape` is a versatile tool designed to build interactive, browser-based,
and deployable visualizations of networks. This enables a more collaborative and more informative visualization process.

With :code:`netshape`, a network edgelist is turned into a web-ready interactive visualization with just one command:

.. code-block:: bash

   > netshape build AwesomeNetwork.csv
   > cd dist
   > netshape server
   > echo "let the visualization begin"


Netshape is also highly configurable and hackable; it supports custom commands,
which enables the development of complex visualization pipelines.
